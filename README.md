Simple php proxy script to validate a token

Dovecot config, allows an introspection, but configuring the fields in theproper headers etc is somewhat tricky.
It also allows a simple post of the token, so its easier and quicker to handle it in this way.

I've done a write up here on configuring Sendmail && Dovecot && Roundcube with Kinde.com oAuth2.
